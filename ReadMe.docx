It's time to play everyone's favorite game: Rocket to Mars!

You are up in space and desperately need to make it to Mars in order to live out your Martian dreams! Unfortunately, there are lots of
Mars look-a-likes -- who would have figured -- and there's a planet that has it out for you and is blocking your way.

Use the arrow keys to naviate your rocket are reach Mars, before you crash into the planet.

Once you have reached 20 Mars look-a-likes, you win! :) But if you hit the planet, you lose. :(

Welcome! You are stranded at sea and need to reach land! Unfortunately, there are too many islands, and you don't know where to go!

The backspace key can be used to go back to the start screen at any time, and you can use the enter key to play again.
